# Morningstar Discord Bot

This is a custom Discord bot for the Morningstar server.  

Its primary purpose is to facilitate the events run in the server (mainly
giveaway events).  



## Ideas

- Questions will be read from file, removed once posted and then put into a
  different `finished.txt` (or something).  
    - When the prompt file is empty, do not post? Or post a random question
      from `finished.txt`?  

- Commands (admin):
    - /addquestion "text"
    - /removequestion number:42 (maybe?)
    - /previewnext to show what will be posted tomorrow

- Add tags automatically ("Daily", "Question")
